## That's me ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜€

Grew up in the analog era. My first mobile was a Nokia 3310. Swapped floppy disks between locations of _Indiana Jones: Fate of Atlantis._

**I love tech, talking robots & computers and top-notch user interfaces.**

Started my career in the broadcast sector, working on well-known TV productions. Launched one of the first online studios, pioneering social media production, while simultaneously developing first-generation TV apps with Philips (HbbTV).

Over time, I have built CMS for startups and renowned media companies. \
Specialized in UI/UX & architecture for international corporations and the finance sector.

Currently working with AI, learning Spanish and automating my smart home. \
(Sometimes Iâ€™ll also fly an A320 from _HAM_ to _PMI_.)
